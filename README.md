# REGISTRATION-CARD
FILTER OUT NECESSARY INFORMATION FROM A REGISTRATION CARD OF A CAR.
I BASICALLY EXTRACT ALL DATA FROM EACH AND EVERY CARD BY USING AWS TEXTRACT.
THEN PREPROCESS THA DATA TO EXTRACT CERTAIN DATA (LIKE:REGISTRATION NO , CHESIS NO , ENGINE NO , MFG DATE , REGISTRATION DATE AND NAME).
TOTAL IMAGE FOR OUR CASE WAS 46 AND WE SUCCESS FULLY ACHIEVED AN ACCURACY OF NEARLY 90% TO EXTRACT DATA FROM ALL THE ABOVE MENTION FEATURES.

I have also given our output.xlx file for the output
